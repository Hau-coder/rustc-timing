    Auto merge of #38856 - zackw:process-envs, r=aturon
    
    Add std::process::Command::envs()
    
    `Command::envs()` adds a vector of key-value pairs to the child
    process environment all at once.  Suggested in #38526.
    
    This is not fully baked and frankly I'm not sure it even _works_, but I need some help finishing it up, and this is the simplest way to show you what I've got.  The problems I know exist and don't know how to solve, from most to least important, are:
    
    * [ ] I don't know if the type signature of the new function is correct.
    * [x] The new test might not be getting run.  I didn't see it go by in the output of `x.py test src/libstd --stage 1`.
    * [x] The tidy check says ``process.rs:402: different `since` than before`` which I don't know what it means.
