    Auto merge of #38313 - jseyfried:self_imports, r=nrc
    
    resolve: clean up the semantics of `self` in an import list
    
    Change `self` in an import list `use foo::bar::{self, ...};` to import `bar` only in the type namespace. Today, `bar` is imported in every namespace in which `foo::bar` is defined.
    
    This is a [breaking-change], see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38293#issue-194817974 for examples of code that would break.
    
    Fixes #38293.
