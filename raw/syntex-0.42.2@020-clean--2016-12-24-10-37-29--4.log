    std: Fix partial writes in LineWriter
    
    Previously the `LineWriter` could successfully write some bytes but then fail to
    report that it has done so. Additionally, an erroneous flush after a successful
    write was permanently ignored. This commit fixes these two issues by (a)
    maintaining a `need_flush` flag to indicate whether a flush should be the first
    operation in `LineWriter::write` and (b) avoiding returning an error once some
    bytes have been successfully written.
    
    Closes #37807
