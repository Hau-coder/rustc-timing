    Auto merge of #39026 - alexcrichton:more-less-cross-stage0, r=aturon
    
    rustbuild: Actually don't build stage0 target rustc
    
    This was attempted in #38853 but erroneously forgot one more case of where the
    compiler was compiled. This commit fixes that up and adds a test to ensure this
    doesn't sneak back in.
