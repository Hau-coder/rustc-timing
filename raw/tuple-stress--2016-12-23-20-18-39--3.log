    Auto merge of #38268 - withoutboats:parse_where_higher_rank_hack, r=eddyb
    
    Prevent where < ident > from parsing.
    
    In order to be forward compatible with `where<'a>` syntax for higher
    rank parameters, prevent potential conflicts with UFCS from parsing
    correctly for the near term.
