    [10/n] Split constants and functions' arguments into disjoint bodies.
    
    _This is part of a series ([prev](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/38053) | [next]()) of patches designed to rework rustc into an out-of-order on-demand pipeline model for both better feature support (e.g. [MIR-based](https://github.com/solson/miri) early constant evaluation) and incremental execution of compiler passes (e.g. type-checking), with beneficial consequences to IDE support as well.
    If any motivation is unclear, please ask for additional PR description clarifications or code comments._

    Finishes the signature-body split started in #37918, namely:
    * `trait` items are separated just like `impl` items were, for uniformity, closing #37712
    * `static`s, `const`s (including associated ones), `enum` discriminants and array lengths get bodies
      * even the count in "repeat expressions", i.e. `n` in `[x; n]`, which fixes #24414
    * arguments' patterns are moved to the bodies, with the types staying in `FnDecl`
      * `&self` now desugars to `self: &Self` instead of `self: &_` (similarly for other `self` forms)
      * `astconv`'s and metadata's (for rustdoc) informative uses are explicitly ignored for the purposes of the dep graph. this could be fixed in the future by hashing the exact information being extracted about the arguments as opposed to generating a dependency on *the whole body*
