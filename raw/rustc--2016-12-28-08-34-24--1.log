    Refactor mir::dataflow: remove Ctxt associated type from BitDenotation trait
    
    Refactor mir::dataflow: remove Ctxt associated type from BitDenotation trait
    
    I no longer remember why I needed this (or thought I did). The way
    that the `BitDenotation` is passed around in all existing use cases
    (and planned future ones), the thing that were in the `Ctxt` can just
    be part of `Self` instead.
    
    (I think ariel had been pushing me to do this back when I first put in
    this infrastructure; it took me a while to see how much of pain the
    `Ctxt` was causing.)
