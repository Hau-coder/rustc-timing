    travis: Attempt to debug OSX linker segfaults
    
    This commit attempts to debug the segfaults that we've been seeing on OSX on
    Travis. I have no idea what's going on here mostly, but let's try to look at
    core dumps and get backtraces to see what's going on. This commit itself is
    mostly a complete shot in the dark, I'm not sure if this even works...
