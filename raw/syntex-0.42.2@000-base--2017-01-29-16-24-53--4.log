    travis: move IBM backwards in time
    
    Using Ubuntu's cross-toolchains for powerpc* and s390x meant they were
    depending on glibc symbols from Ubuntu 16.04. And if that host is ever
    updated to a new release, the toolchains would raise the bar too.
    
    This switches powerpc, powerpc64, and s390x to use crosstool-ng
    toolchains, configured approximately like RHEL6 with kernel 2.6.32 and
    glibc 2.12. This ABI level should also be compatible with Debian 7
    (wheezy) and Ubuntu 12.04 (precise).
    
    For powerpc64le, the challenge was that only glibc-2.19 officially added
    support, but RHEL7 backported those changes to glibc-2.17. The backport
    patches are complex and numerous, so instead of trying to push those
    into crosstool-ng, this just uses glibc binaries directly from CentOS 7
    and builds the toolchain manually.
    
    This is ported from rust-lang/rust-buildbot#149.
