    travis: Turn off core dumps on OSX
    
    I've seen these take up quite a bit of log space and I have the sneaking
    suspicion that they're just making our test suite take longer (sometimes timing
    out on 32-bit OSX now). In any case the backtraces haven't proven too useful,
    unfortunately.
