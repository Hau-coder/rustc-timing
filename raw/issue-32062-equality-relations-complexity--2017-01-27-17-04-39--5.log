    rustc: Remove all "consider using an explicit lifetime parameter" suggestions
    
    These give so many incorrect suggestions that having them is
    detrimental to the user experience. The compiler should not be
    suggesting changes to the code that are wrong - it is infuriating: not
    only is the compiler telling you that _you don't understand_ borrowing,
    _the compiler itself_ appears to not understand borrowing. It does not
    inspire confidence.
