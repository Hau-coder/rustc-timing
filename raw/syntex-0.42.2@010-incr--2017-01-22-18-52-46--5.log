    Remove proc_macro from the tidy whitelist again
    
    PR #38842 has exposed that we were missing the src/test/compile-fail-fulldeps
    directory in the search for feature gate tests. Because the detection didn't
    work despite the effort to name the test appropriately and add a correct
    "// gate-test-proc_macro" comment, proc_macro was added to the whitelist.
    
    We fix this little weakness in the feature gate tidy check and add
    the src/test/compile-fail-fulldeps directory to the checked directories.
    
    Part of issue #39059 .
