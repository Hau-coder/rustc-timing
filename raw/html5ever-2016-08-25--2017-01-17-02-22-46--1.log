    travis: Pass --release-channel=nightly on deploy
    
    This commit passes the `--release-channel=nightly` flag to all images which have
    the `DEPLOY` flag set. This means that we'll name artifacts and the compiler
    appropriately.
    
    This reworks a bit how arguments are passed, but for now doesn't change what's
    already being passed. Eventually we'll want to avoid enabling debug assertions
    and llvm assertions for *all* releases, but I figure we can tackle that a little
    bit more down the road.
