    Auto merge of #39206 - MJDSys:fix_rustbuild_libdir, r=alexcrichton
    
    Fix rustbuild to work with --libdir.
    
    Similar to the makefiles, pass CFG_LIBDIR_RELATIVE to cargo when building
    rustc in stages > 0.  This tells rustc to check the different directory.
    
    I'm not sure how you want this handled in the toml system (my distribution, Gentoo, uses configure still).  I have a feeling the system needs a rework anyways for rustbuild.  If there is some discussion that needs to happen, could you merge this in the mean time?  I'd be happy to help transition this to a better method.
