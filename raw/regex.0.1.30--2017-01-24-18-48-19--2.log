    rustbuild: Start building --enable-extended
    
    This commit adds a new flag to the configure script,
    `--enable-extended`, which is intended for specifying a desire to
    compile the full suite of Rust tools such as Cargo, the RLS, etc. This
    is also an indication that the build system should create combined
    installers such as the pkg/exe/msi artifacts.
    
    Currently the `--enable-extended` flag just indicates that combined
    installers should be built, and Cargo is itself not compiled just yet
    but rather only downloaded from its location. The intention here is to
    quickly get to feature parity with the current release process and then
    we can start improving it afterwards.
    
    All new files in this PR inside `src/etc/installer` are copied from the
    rust-packaging repository.
