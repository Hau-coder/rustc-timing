    process trait/impl items directly from the visitor callback
    
    The current setup processes impl/trait items while visiting
    the impl/trait. This means we basically have this setup:
    
        <Lots> -> TypeckItemBody(Impl) -> Tables(ImplItem{0,1,2,3})
    
    But this was largely an artifact of the older code. By moving the
    processing of items into method dedicated for their use, we produce this
    setup:
    
        <Little> -> TypeckItemBody(ImplItem0) -> Tables(ImplItem0)
        ...
        <Little> -> TypeckItemBody(ImplItem3) -> Tables(ImplItem3)
    
    r? @michaelwoerister
    
    Also, we might consider removing the `TypeckItemBody` node altogether and just using `Tables` as the task. `Tables` is its primary output, I imagine? That would reduce size of dep-graph somewhat.
    
    cc @eddyb -- perhaps this pattern applies elsewhere?
