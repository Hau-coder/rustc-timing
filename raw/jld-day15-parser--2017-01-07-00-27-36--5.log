    E0088/E0090 fix
    
    This fixes an issue reported by @eddyb (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/36208#issuecomment-2707092230) where the check for "too few lifetime parameters" was removed in one of the error message PRs.
    
    I also removed the span shrinking from E0088, as early bound lifetimes give you a confusing underline in some cases.
