    syntax: remove abi::Os and abi::Architecture
    
    They're long dead since the switch to flexible targets, but was not removed like their consumers were. Interesting they even got maintained by various porters out there!
    
    Technically [syntax-breaking] as they're public API, but since they're unused in the compiler, the potential breakage IMO should be minimal.
