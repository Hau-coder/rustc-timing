    Auto merge of #38679 - alexcrichton:always-deny-warnings, r=nrc
    
    Remove not(stage0) from deny(warnings)
    
    Historically this was done to accommodate bugs in lints, but there hasn't been a
    bug in a lint since this feature was added which the warnings affected. Let's
    completely purge warnings from all our stages by denying warnings in all stages.
    This will also assist in tracking down `stage0` code to be removed whenever
    we're updating the bootstrap compiler.
