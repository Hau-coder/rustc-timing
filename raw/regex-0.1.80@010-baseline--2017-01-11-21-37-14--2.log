    std: Ignore close_read_wakes_up on Windows
    
    It looks like in practice at least this test will not pass on Windows.
    Empirically it is prone to blocking forever, presumably because a call to
    `shutdown` doesn't actually wake up other threads on Windows.
    
    We don't document this as a guarantee for `shutdown`, nor do we internally rely
    on it. This test originated in a time long since passed when it was leveraged
    for canceling I/O, but nowadays there's nothing fancy happening in the standard
    library so it's not really a productive test anyway, hence just ignoring it on
    Windows.
    
    Closes #31657
