    Auto merge of #38960 - arielb1:blake-endian, r=michaelwoerister
    
    Use little-endian encoding for Blake2 hashing on all architectures
    
    Like many hash functions, the blake2 hash is mathematically defined on
    a sequence of 64-bit words. As Rust's hash interface operates on
    sequences of octets, some encoding must be used to bridge that
    difference.
    
    The Blake2 RFC (RFC 7693) specifies that:
    ```
       Byte (octet) streams are interpreted as words in little-endian order,
       with the least-significant byte first.
    ```
    
    So use that encoding consistently.
    
    Fixes #38891.
    
    Beta-nominating since this is a regression since 1.15.
