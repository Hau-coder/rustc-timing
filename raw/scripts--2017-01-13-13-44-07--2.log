    Auto merge of #39036 - aidanhs:aphs-robust-docker, r=alexcrichton
    
    Remove strictly-unnecessary flags for docker
    
    cc #39035
    
    In addition to `--tty` I've removed `--interactive` as I don't think there's any reason for it to be there (it only hooks up stdin, which shouldn't be used anyway).
    
    If this looks like it's working over a few days then I'll also alter the libc scripts.
