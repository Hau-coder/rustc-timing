    Auto merge of #38934 - Manishearth:nodrop, r=eddyb
    
    Remove destructor-related restrictions from unions
    
    They don't have drop glue.
    
    This doesn't fix the rvalue promotion issues when trying to do things like `static FOO: NoDrop<Bar> = NoDrop {inner: Bar}`. I'm not sure if we should fix that.
