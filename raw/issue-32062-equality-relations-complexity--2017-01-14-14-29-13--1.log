    Auto merge of #38992 - nagisa:i128-minvallit, r=eddyb
    
    Fix two const-eval issues related to i128 negation
    
    First issue here was the fact that weâ€™d only allow negating integers in i64 range in case the
    integer was not infered yes. While this is not the direct cause of the issue, its still good to fix
    it.
    
    The real issue here is the code handling specifically the `min_value` literals. While I128_OVERFLOW
    has the expected value (0x8000_..._0000), match using this value as a pattern is handled
    incorrectly by the stage1 compiler (it seems to be handled correctly, by the stage2 compiler). So
    what we do here is extract this pattern into an explicit `==` until the next snapshot.
    
    Fixes #38987
