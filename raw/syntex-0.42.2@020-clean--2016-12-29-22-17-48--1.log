    appveyor: Attempt to debug flaky test runs
    
    This commit is an attempt to debug #38620 since we're unable to reproduce it
    locally. It follows the [advice] of those with AppVeyor to use the `handle.exe`
    tool to try to debug what processes have a handle to the file open.
    
    This won't be guaranteed to actually help us, but hopefully it'll diagnose
    something at some point?
