    Auto merge of #38569 - chris-morgan:rustdoc-highlight-kw-2, r=steveklabnik
    
    Fix rustdoc highlighting of `&` and `*`
    
    Whitespace tokens were included, so the span check used with `&` was incorrect, and it was never highlighted as kw-2 (RefKeyword).
    
    The `*` in `*foo` and `*const T` should also be highlighted kw-2, so I added them. Note that this *will* cause mishighlighting of code like `1*2`, but that should have been written `1 * 2`. Same deal with `1&2`.
