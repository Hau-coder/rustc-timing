    Point to immutable arg/fields when trying to use as &mut
    
    Present the following output when trying to access an immutable borrow's
    field as mutable:
    
    ```
    error[E0389]: cannot borrow data mutably in a `&` reference
      --> $DIR/issue-38147-1.rs:27:9
       |
    26 | fn f(&self) {
       |      -----  use `&mut self` here to make mutable
    27 |     f.s.push('x');
       |     ^^^ assignment into an immutable reference
    ```
    
    And the following when trying to access an immutable struct field as mutable:
    
    ```
    error: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content `*self.s` as mutable
      --> $DIR/issue-38147-3.rs:17:9
       |
    12 |     s: &'a String
       |     ------------- use `&'a mut String` here to make mutable

    16 |     fn f(&self) {
       |          -----  use `&mut self` here to make mutable
    17 |         self.s.push('x');
       |         ^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
    ```
    
    Fixes #38147.
