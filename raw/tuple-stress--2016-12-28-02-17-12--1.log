    Auto merge of #38589 - aidanhs:aphs-stage0-rustdoc-test, r=alexcrichton
    
    Teach `rustdoc --test` about `--sysroot`, pass it when testing rust
    
    This permits rustdoc tests to work in stage0.
    
    Logical continuation of #36586.
    
    Snippet from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38575#issuecomment-269090724:
    
    > it should actually be possible to run all the libstd tests immediately after creating std of stage0-out - there's no reason to build librustc at all if you've just made a change to (for example) libcollections, `./x.py test src/libcollections --stage 0 -v --incremental` should just work
    
    This PR makes it so (or appears to in my testing).
