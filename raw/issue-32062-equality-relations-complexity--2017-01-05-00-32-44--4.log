    Auto merge of #38756 - Mark-Simulacrum:2nd-trans-cleanup, r=eddyb
    
    Additional cleanup to rustc_trans
    
    Removes `BlockAndBuilder`, `FunctionContext`, and `MaybeSizedValue`.
    
    `LvalueRef` is used instead of `MaybeSizedValue`, which has the added benefit of making functions operating on `Lvalue`s be able to take just that (since it encodes the type with an `LvalueTy`, which can carry discriminant information) instead of a `MaybeSizedValue` and a discriminant.
