    Properly ban the negation of unsigned integers in type-checking.
    
    Lint-time banning of unsigned negation appears to be vestigial from a time it was feature-gated.
    But now it always errors and we do have the ability to deref the checking of e.g. `-0`, through the trait obligation fulfillment context, which will only succeed/error when the `0` gets inferred to a specific type.
    
    The two removed tests are the main reason for finally cleaning this up, they need changing all the time when refactoring the HIR-based `rustc_const_eval` and/or `rustc_passes::consts`, as warnings pile up.
