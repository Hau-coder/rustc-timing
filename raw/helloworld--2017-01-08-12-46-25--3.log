    rustbuild: Don't build target compilers in stage0
    
    The `doc-book` and `doc-nomicon` steps accidentally depended on a rustbook
    compiled by a cross-compiled compiler, which isn't necessary. Be sure to set the
    `host` on these dependency edges to the build compiler to ensure that we're
    always using a tool compiled for the host platform.
    
    This was discovered trawling the build logs for the new dist bots and
    discovering that they're building one too many compilers in stage0.
