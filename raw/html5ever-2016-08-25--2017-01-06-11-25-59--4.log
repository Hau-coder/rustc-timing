    Auto merge of #38304 - sfackler:no-ipv6only, r=alexcrichton
    
    Deprecate TcpListener::set_only_v6
    
    This was supposed to have been removed in #33124 but snuck through :(
    
    Should the docs be removed?
    
    I left the accessor undeprecated since it should actually work, though that method doesn't exist on other networking types.
