    Auto merge of #39020 - michaelwoerister:dep-graph-dfs-caching, r=nikomatsakis
    
    incr.comp.: Add some caching to Predecessors construction.
    
    This speeds up the "serialize dep graph" pass for libsyntax from 45 secs to 15 secs on my machine. Still far from ideal, but things will get better when we change the metadata hashing strategy.
    
    The `CACHING_THRESHOLD` value of 60 has been arrived at experimentally. It seemed to give the best speedup.
