    libtest: add --list option to list tests and benchmarks
    
    This option lists all the tests and benchmarks a binary provides without running any of them.
    By default the listing is sent to stdout (intended for human consumption), but if `--logfile` is also specified, it is also written there in an easily parsable form.
    
    If filters are specified, they're applied before the output is emitted. The human output will also include a summary unless `-q` is specified.
