    Auto merge of #39048 - lambda:impl-tosocketaddrs-for-string, r=alexcrichton
    
    impl ToSocketAddrs for String
    
    `ToSocketAddrs` is implemented for a number of different types,
    including `(IpAddr, u16)`, `&str`, and various others, for the
    convenience of being able to run things like
    `TcpListener::bind("10.11.12.13:1415")`.  However, because this is a
    generic parameter with a trait bound, if you have a `String` you cannot
    pass it in, either directly as `TcpListener::bind(string)`, or the
    `TcpListener::bind(&string)` as you might expect due to deref coercion;
    you have to use `TcpListener::bind(&*string)`, which is noisy and hard
    to discover (though #39029 suggests better error messages to make it
    more discoverable).
    
    Rather than making people stumble over this, just implement
    `ToSocketAddrs` for `String`.
