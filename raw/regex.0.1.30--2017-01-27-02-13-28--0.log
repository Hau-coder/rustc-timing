    Auto merge of #39281 - michaelwoerister:make-cc-incr-comp-opt-in, r=nikomatsakis
    
    incr.comp.: Make cross-crate tracking for incr. comp. opt-in.
    
    The current implementation of cross-crate dependency tracking can cause quite long compile times and high memory usage for some crates (see #39208 for example). This PR therefore makes that part of dependency tracking optional. Incremental compilation still works, it will only have very coarse dep-tracking for upstream crates.
