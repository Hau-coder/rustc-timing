    incr.comp.: Delete orphaned work-products.
    
    The new partitioning scheme uncovered a hole in our incr. comp. cache directory garbage collection. So far, we relied on unneeded work products being deleted during the initial cache invalidation phase. However, we the new scheme, we get object files/work products that only contain code from upstream crates. Sometimes this code is not needed anymore (because all callers have been removed from the source) but because nothing that actually influences the contents of these work products had changed, we never deleted them from disk.
