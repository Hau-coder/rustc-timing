    Auto merge of #38733 - sfackler:peek-mut-pop, r=alexcrichton
    
    Add PeekMut::pop
    
    A fairly common workflow is to put a bunch of stuff into a binary heap
    and then mutate the top value until its empty. This both makes that a
    bit more convenient (no need to save a boolean off and pop after to
    avoid borrowck issues), and a bit more efficient since you only shift
    once.
