    Auto merge of #39110 - petrochenkov:sum, r=eddyb
    
    Merge ObjectSum and PolyTraitRef in AST/HIR + some other refactoring
    
    `ObjectSum` and `PolyTraitRef` are the same thing (list of bounds), they exist separately only due to parser quirks. The second commit merges them.
    
    The first commit replaces `Path` with `Ty` in (not yet supported) equality predicates. They are parsed as types anyway and arbitrary types can always be disguised as paths using aliases, so this doesn't add any new functionality.
    
    The third commit uses `Vec` instead of `P<[T]>` in AST. AST is not immutable like HIR and `Vec`s are more convenient for it, unnecessary conversions are also avoided.
    
    The last commit renames `parse_ty_sum` (which is used for parsing types in general) into `parse_ty`, and renames `parse_ty` (which is used restricted contexts where `+` is not permitted due to operator priorities or other reasons) into `parse_ty_no_plus`.
    
    This is the first part of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39085#issuecomment-272743755 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39080 focused on data changes and mechanical renaming, I'll submit a PR with parser changes a bit later.
