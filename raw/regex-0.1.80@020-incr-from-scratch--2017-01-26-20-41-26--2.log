    Bounds parsing refactoring 2
    
    See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37511 for previous discussion.

    Relaxed parsing rules:
     - zero bounds after `:` are allowed in all contexts.
     - zero predicates are allowed after `where`.
    - trailing separator `,` is allowed after predicates in `where` clauses not followed by `{`.
    
    Other parsing rules:
     - trailing separator `+` is still allowed in all bound lists.
    
    Code is also cleaned up and tests added.
    
    I haven't touched parsing of trait object types yet, I'll do it later.
