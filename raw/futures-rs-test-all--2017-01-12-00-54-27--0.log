    Auto merge of #37926 - bluss:from-utf8-small-simplification, r=sfackler
    
    UTF-8 validation: Compute block end upfront
    
    Simplify the conditional used for ensuring that the whole word loop is
    only used if there are at least two whole words left to read.
    
    This makes the function slightly smaller and simpler, a 0-5% reduction
    in runtime for various test cases.
