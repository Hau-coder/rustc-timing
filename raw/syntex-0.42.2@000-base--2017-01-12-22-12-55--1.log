    travis: Start uploading artifacts on commits
    
    This commit starts adding the infrastructure for uploading release artifacts
    from AppVeyor/Travis on each commit. The idea is that eventually we'll upload a
    full release to AppVeyor/Travis in accordance with plans [outlined earlier].
    
    Right now this configures Travis/Appveyor to upload all tarballs in the `dist`
    directory, and various images are updated to actually produce tarballs in these
    directories. These are nowhere near ready to be actual release artifacts, but
    this should allow us to play around with it and test it out. Once this commit
    lands we should start seeing artifacts uploaded on each commit.
