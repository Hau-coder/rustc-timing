    Auto merge of #38770 - steveklabnik:doc-custom-derive, r=alexcrichton
    
    Document custom derive.
    
    These are some bare-bones documentation for custom derive, needed
    to stabilize "macros 1.1",
    https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35900
    
    The book chapter is based off of a blog post by @cbreeden,
    https://cbreeden.github.io/Macros11/
    
    Normally, we have a policy of not mentioning external crates in
    documentation. However, given that syn/quote are basically neccesary
    for properly using macros 1.1, I feel that not including them here
    would make the documentation very bad. So the rules should be bent
    in this instance.
    
    So far, this PR includes only docs; @alexcrichton said in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35900 that he'd be okay with landing them before stabilization; I don't mind either way.
