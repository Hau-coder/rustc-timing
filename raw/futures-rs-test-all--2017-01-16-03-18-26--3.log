    Auto merge of #39071 - est31:master, r=GuillaumeGomez
    
    Mark safe_suggestion and pushpop_unsafe as removed in feature_gate.rs
    
    This removes two features from feature_gate.rs: `safe_suggestion` and `pushpop_unsafe`. Both had been removed in other places already, but were forgotten to be removed from feature_gate.rs.
    
    * `safe_suggestion` was added in commit 164f0105bb65f31b89e5fb7f368c9e6f5833a3f8 and then removed again in commit c11fe553df269d6f47b4c48f5c47c08efdd373dc both in the same PR #38099.
    
    * `pushpop_unsafe` was added in commit 1829fa5199bae5a192c771807c532badce14be37 and removed again in commit d399098fd82e0bf3ed61bbbbcdbb0b6adfa4c808
    
    Removes two elements from the whitelist of non gate tested unstable lang features (issue #39059).
