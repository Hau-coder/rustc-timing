    Auto merge of #38353 - alexcrichton:fix-nightiles, r=alexcrichton
    
    Another round of nightly fixes
    
    Another three separate errors happened last night:
    
    * Race condition in save analysis failed the OX build
    * Packaging docs that don't exist failed the Android build
    * Packaging save-analysis that doesn't exist failed the cross host builds
    
    It just never ends...
